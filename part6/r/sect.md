The notion in the Late Latin development is "those following (someone's) way." But the history of the word seems to be confused with that of Latin *secta*, fem. past participle of *secare* "to cut" (from PIE root [*sek-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*sek-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to cut"). The meaning "separately organized religious body, denomination" is recorded from 1570s in a Protestant context and seems to carry more of a notion of a party "cut off" from a main body.

Examples:

1. insect = in + sect

2. section = sect + ion

3. dissect = dis + sect 

4. intersect = inter + sect

5. transect = tran + sect
