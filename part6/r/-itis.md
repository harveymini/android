# -itis

[link](https://www.etymonline.com/word/-itis#etymonline_v_12289)

word-forming element in medicine denoting "diseases characterized by inflammation" (of the specified part), Modern Latin, from Greek *-itis*, feminine of adjectival suffix *-ites* "pertaining to." Feminine because it was used with an implied *nosos* "disease," a feminine noun; especially in *arthritis (nosos)* "(disease) of the joints." [Arthritis](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Arthritis?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (16c.) was one of the earliest appearances of the suffix in English and from it the suffix was abstracted in other uses.

Examples:

1. spondylitis = spondyl + itis
2. arthritis = arthr + itis
3. myelitis = myel + itis
4. enteritis = enter + itis
