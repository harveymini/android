# Application Components

Application components are the essential building blocks of an Android application. These components are loosely coupled by the application  manifest file AndroidManifest.xml that describes each component of the application and how they interact.

There are following four main components that can be used within an Android application.

| Component           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Activities          | They dictate the UI and handle the user interaction to the smart phone screen. |
| Services            | They handle background processing associated with an application. |
| Broadcast Receivers | They handle communication between Android OS and applications. |
| Content Providers   | They handle data and database management issues.             |
